7.10.18
Project Created with create-react-app. You should install it with (sudo) npm install -g create-react-app <br/>
The following custom modules added:
1. @material-ui/core
2. @material-ui/lab
3. immutability-helper - used by reducers for shallow copy;
4. redux  - to create centralized data store (get rid of long chains of callbacks) and debug with redux dev tools.
5. react-redux
6. prop-types

Added .env absolute path to enable import .. from 'components/simpleComponent' instead of '../../../simpleComponent'.
